This is a project I am using to experiment with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). I may turn it into an address book and carpool-possibility-finding app over time.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Most of the files were created by the `create-react-app` script and the scripts it invokes. I originally copied `src/Excel.css` from the [*React: Up and Running* accompanying files repository](https://github.com/stoyan/reactbook). I wrote `src/Excel.js` using what I learned from various sources, including *React: Up and Running*. The book gave me the idea for the sortable & editable table application, but I tried to write as much of the code on my own as possible, referring to the book only when necessary.
